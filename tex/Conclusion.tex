\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The CP invariance of Higgs boson coupling to vector bosons has been tested in VBF \Hyy process with $140 fb^{-1}$ 13TeV proton-proton collision data collected by ATLAS detector in its full Run2 period. The measurement is performed in differential Optimal Observable region within SMEFT model, the BSM Higgs coupling contributing to CP are represented with $c_{HW}$, xxx, xxx. \\
